tie_fighter_airframe_0:0 "TIE Fighter"
tie_fighter_airframe_0_desc:0 "A standard issue starfighter manufactured in large numbers by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Imperial Navy. It has twin ion engines powered by a solar reactor. Its stock armament is a pair of laser cannons. It's most commonly used for air superiority."
tie_fighter_airframe_1:0 "TIE Fighter II"
tie_fighter_airframe_1_desc:0 "An upgraded version of the TIE figher, it functions practically the same. Manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, it has an improved pair of ion engines and wings with design inspirations from the TIE Interceptor class."
tie_fighter_airframe_2:0 "TIE Dagger"
tie_fighter_airframe_2_desc:0 "An experimental design manufactured by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems to replace the TIE/LN series. The TIE Dagger doubles it's armaments with dual heavy laser cannons, in addition to the stock laser cannons. Rudimentary shields have also been equipped."
tie_fighter_airframe_3:0 "TIE Predator"
tie_fighter_airframe_3_desc:0 "The TIE Predator is the future of starfighter combat. Manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, this high-tech TIE class fighter comes equipped with shielding, class 1 hyperdrive, and the most up to date reactor in the galaxy. Truly, a force to be reckoned with."
tie_interceptor_airframe_0:0 "TIE Interceptor"
tie_interceptor_airframe_0_desc:0 "The TIE Interceptor, manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, was a symbol of the Empire on the battlefield. While similar to the TIE Fighter in terms of armaments, the TIE Interceptor instead has twin P-s5.6 ion engines, combined with it's small size it's an incredibly agile starfighter."
tie_interceptor_airframe_1:0 "TIE Hunter"
tie_interceptor_airframe_1_desc:0 "The TIE Hunter, manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, was designed and built to counteract the Rebel Alliance's use of T-65 X-Wings in the Galactic Civil War. It comes equipped with an array of blaster cannons, as well as a proton torpedo launcher. On top of this, it also has a hyperdrive and shielding."
tie_interceptor_airframe_2:0 "TIE Raptor"
tie_interceptor_airframe_2_desc:0 "This... frankly insane idea has been proposed more as an inside joke than a true fighter. Some starbases have reported building these out of spare parts to decent success, and there really wouldn't be any harm in having Siener Fleet Systems manufacture some for us. It does have decent agility and armaments compared to a standard TIE..."
tie_interceptor_airframe_3:0 "TIE Silencer"
tie_interceptor_airframe_3_desc:0 "The TIE Silencer is another advanced prototype manufactured by the Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems subsidiary. Taking inspiration from the TIE Defender as a hybrid fighter-bomber, the TIE silencer comes equipped with a stunning array of weapons, from missile launchers to blaster cannons. It also has a stealth generator, shielding, hyperdrive, and even an armored cockpit."
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_0:0 "TIE Advanced"
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_0_desc:0 "The TIE Advanced, manufactured by the Sienar Fleet Systems, was developed to be the replacement to the standard TIE Fighter. While it didn't fulfill that role, it has become the standard for our elite pilots. It comes with a pair of laser cannons, as well as a cluster missile launcher. It also, uniquely, has a class four hyperdrive with a ten jump limit."
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_1:0 "TIE Opressor"
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_1_desc:0 "The TIE Oppressor, manufactured by the Sienar Fleet Systems, is an oddity. It uses engines from a TIE fighter, but with the firepower of a bomber and fighter. While perhaps slower than some of our bombers and fighers, they have a relatively heavy hull and even shielding."
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_2:0 "TIE Agressor"
tie_fighterbomber_airframe_2_desc:0 "The TIE Aggressor, manufactured by the Sienar Fleet Systems, is the ultimate fighter-bomber hybrid. Faster and equally armored as it's predecessors, it has an array of laser cannons spread across it, while also having a missile launcher. The amount of weapons calls for a gunner, one of our few starfighters to have a crew of two."
tie_bomber_airframe_0:0 "TIE Bomber"
tie_bomber_airframe_0_desc:0 "Notably wider than the standard TIE Fighter, the TIE Bomber was manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems to act as a general purpose bomber. It has two hulls, one for the pilot, while the other holds a payload of up to fifteen tons. However, the bomber is slow and lacks maneuverability compared to any other TIE series fighter or bomber."
tie_bomber_airframe_1:0 "TIE Heavy Bomber"
tie_bomber_airframe_1_desc:0 "Manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, this bomber is the logical conclusion of the TIE Bomber. It has dual weapon pods, effectively doubling the payload limit of the bomber. While heavier, better tuned engines make up for it, resulting in little to no loss of speed."
tie_bomber_airframe_2:0 "TIE Interdictor"
tie_bomber_airframe_2_desc:0 "The TIE Interdictor, manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, is a terrifying force to be reckoned with. Again, the armaments have been doubled, resulting in one Interdictor being able to fulfill the role of four TIE bombers. The Interdictor still suffers from the weight and speed issues of it's predecessors, but makes up for it in sheer firepower."
tie_automated:0 "TIE Automated"
tie_automated_desc:0 "While droid starfighters are nothing new, the TIE Automated is our first attempt at one of our own. Manufactured as a joint effort between Sienar Fleet Systems and Cybot Galactica, the starfighter itself is practically the same as a TIE fighter, but the lack of a main pilot means there's no fear, hesitation, or pesky self-preservation that a sentient pilot would have."

tie_hunter_upgrade:0 "TIE Hunter Upgrade"
tie_hunter_upgrade_desc:0 "The TIE Hunter was designed to counter the T-65 X-Wing. While it can counter it, some upgrades to it's agility would surely push it past the X-Wing."
tie_phantom:0 "TIE Silencer"
tie_phantom_upgrade:0 "TIE Silencer Upgrade"
tie_phantom_upgrade_desc:0 "While the TIE Silencer has an incredibly amount of upsides, it's combat agility is lacking. However, some changes to the engines and distribution of armor will boost this."

tie_defender_airframe_0:0 "TIE Defender"
tie_defender_airframe_desc:0 "The TIE Defender, manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, is by far the most advanced ship designed to-date. It functions primariyl as a multi-role fighter, coming equipped with an array of ion cannons, blaster cannons, warhead launchers, and even an otpion for a tractor beam projector. It also has both shielding and a hyperdrive, rare things on TIE series fighters."
tie_fighter_upgrade:0 "TIE Fighter Upgrade"
tie_fighter_upgrade_desc:0 "Newer blaster cannons allow for both quicker equipment conversion, and improved firepower on the TIE series."
tie_fighter_2_airframe_0:0 "TIE Fighter 2"
tie_fighter_2_upgrade:0 "TIE Fighter 2 Upgrade"
tie_fighter_2_upgrade_desc:0 "Some slight tweaks to the engine of our TIE series Fighters will allow for more agility in dogfights."
tie_dagger:0 "TIE Dagger"

advanced_tech:0 "Advanced Tech"
advanced_tech_desc:0 "New research breakthroughs and advancements in starship manufacturing has opened up the door to some new options for our fleets."
tie_phantom_airframe_0:0 "TIE Phantom"
tie_phantom_airframe_0_desc:0 "While based off an older design, this stealth ship manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems will lead the charge on aerial stealth missions. While posessing an absurd number of laser cannons, it also requires a secondary gunner to pilot, as well as a hyperdrive and self-destruct mechanism for one-way missions."
tie_automated_airframe_0:0 "TIE Automated"
tie_advanced_airframe_0:0 "TIE Advanced"
tie_advanced_upgrade:0 "TIE Advanced Upgrade"
tie_advanced_upgrade_desc:0 "The TIE Advanced is one of our finest pieces of work yet... \n\n...But with some fine tuning, it could be better."
tie_oppressor_airframe_0:0 "TIE Oppressor"
tie_aggressor_airframe_0:0 "TIE Aggressor"

tie_bomber_upgrade:0 "TIE Bomber Upgrade"
tie_bomber_upgrade_desc:0 "Fixing some minor errors in the TIE's bombing system would result in quicker deployment of payloads, even if by only a small amount of time."

lancer_1:0 "Lancer-class Frigate"
lancer_1_desc:0 "The Lancer-class Frigate, manufactured by the Kuat Drive Yards, is designed to act as a fast and agile screening ship. Armed with twenty point-defense laser cannons, it excels against starfighters, both on attack and defense."
raider_1:0 "Raider-class Corvette"
raider_hull_desc:0 "The Raider-class Corvette manufactured by the Kuat Drive Yards was the Empire's response to the Rebellion's starfighter-focused strategy. While mostly used as a patrol ship in the outer rim, it can be repurposed as an anti-starfighter attack platform in a traditional fleet, using it's heavy laser cannons and ion cannons to act as a screening vessel."
raider_2:0 "Raider II-class II Corvette"
arquitens_1:0 "Arquintens Command Cruiser"
arquitens_1_desc:0 "The Arquintens-class command cruiser is an updated variant of Kuat Drive Yards' Arquitens-class light cruiser, with updated weaponry to fit the Galactic Civil War. It can take on multiple roles, as a command ship, blockade ship, battleship, and defensive support ship. It is equipped with turbolasers, concussion missile launchers, and a tractor beam projector."
