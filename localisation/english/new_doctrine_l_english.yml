 IMPERIAL_DOCTRINE_TITLE:0 "Imperial Response"
 IMPERIAL_DOCTRINE_DESC:0 "With the Empire destroyed as we know it, our forces are outnumbered on every front as inusurgents have us on the back foot. Quick thinking and retaliation should at least buy us some time to adjust."

 CORP_CONSORTIUM_DESC:0 "In times of uncertainity, there's only one solution: Our product. Let's force the markets open with our offers to make money off this new age."
 REPUBLIC_DOCTRINE_TITLE:0 "A New Republic"
 REPUBLIC_DOCTRINE_DESC:0 "We finally have the advantage, we no longer need hit and run tactics and can take the fight to the oppressors. Using our highly trained special forces and new volunteers, let us take back our galaxy!"
 NEUTRAL_THREAT_TITLE:0 "Shadow In the Galaxy"
 NEUTRAL_THREAT_DESC:0 "While they squabble, we reside in the darkness. Waiting, learning, adapting, they will know true terror when we emerge, may they die quickly."
 NEUTRAL_OBSERVER_TITLE:0 "A New Age"
 NEUTRAL_OBSERVER_DESC:0 "While the Galaxy set itself on fire, we waited looking onwards at the devastation. We have learnt from their mistakes and victories, we won't be caught offguard in this uncertainity."

naval_reimagining_desc:0 "After Endor, it is time we take a long look at the tactics we've used up till now. The galaxy is a changing place, and our old doctrines won't remain as viable as they once were."
dispersed_formations_desc:0 "Proper training to fly in a formation is important. It allows freedom of movement for every ship involved, better target acquisition, as well as more organization among units."
superiority_of_snubfighters_desc:0 "While this doctrine was used unofficially pre-Endor, with the state of total war in the galaxy it is time to acknowledge that wars will be fought and won in the seats of small, 1-2 man fighters."
escort_carrier_doctrine_desc:0 "While wars may be fought and won in snubfighters, we must admit their weakness in smaller numbers. As such, we will begin to focus on our carriers as escorts to the starfighters."
stateless_navy_desc:0 "Our navy comes from all over. We should not only admit this, but embrace it as our strength. Our navy is not our own, but one that comes from over the galaxy to fight for one goal!"
a_meaningful_war_desc:0 "The wars we fight are not waged for territorial or personal gain. They are fought for justice! For liberty! We must make our navy aware of this, and make sure they fight with that knowledge."
celebrated_aces_desc:0 "To put a face and name onto the fighters of our navy is a valuable thing. To not celebrate our aces would be nothing short of a missed opportunity."
one_fleet_one_chance_desc:0 "More often than not in modern conflicts, a war's tide can be shifted by one battle, one moment. Yavin, Hoth, and Endor to name a few in recent memory. Our navies will act as if they are always on the razor's edge, as they might unknowingly be."
departmental_oversight_desc:0 "The days of departments in ships doing as they please with no oversight is over. It may be unpopular, and it may be costly, but it will be safe."
independant_operations_desc:0 "While our navy serves us, we can not know what happens on the battlefield entirely. Instead, we should let captains and admirals on ships make calls more independnetly from their fleet."
a_veterans_navy_desc:0 "Most of our spacers have been flying for upwards of a decade in this war. Some even longer. It is time we make use of this expertise, and allow our newer recruits to learn from the old."
off_balance_their_defences_desc:0 "Our enemies defences are set up in such a way that they clearly expect us to fight on their rules. If we not only change these rules, but turn their defensive positions against them, our victory is all but assured."
pilot_training_program_desc:0 "It is not hard to get into a starfighter and take off. Nor is it hard to fire the weapon systems. It is hard, however, to do so effectively. It is time we formalize our training program."
the_back_foot_desc:0 "We've been on the back foot in a fight before, but we did not back down then, and we will not now!"
modularized_components_desc:0 "Adjustments to our systems and weapons will allow them all to become modularized. In the long term, this will make newer starship designs even easier to put together."
make_the_cost_too_great_desc:0 "If your enemy can easily defeat you, your only option is to make the road to defeating you a far too difficult one."
a_rustbucket_navy_desc:0 "Throughout all of galactic history, fleets have been made up of nothing but ragtag ships. Converted civilian ships, outdated military ships, and makeshift rustbuckets... and they won. Who's to say we can't do the same?"
hit_and_hyperdrive_desc:0 "If our enemy outnumbers us, they will seek to fight us on a level playing field. We must not let their entire military might bear down on us at once. We must tear them apart, piece by piece, running to safety between pieces."
hidden_fighter_support_desc:0 "Galactic warfare is confusing, violent, and often times you don't see everything going on... we should train our fighters to take advantage of such a reality."
superstructure_bombing_runs_desc:0 "Bombing runs against superstructures and other targets of similar sizes are harder than one would imagine, yet the damage they can inflict is worth the risk."
independent_fighter_squadrons_desc:0 "Fighter squadrons possess the unique ability of having the most first-hand experience in a battle. It is time we take advantage of this by allowing them to make judgement calls and strategies as they go, rather than be told what to do by far-away admirals."
a_raiders_mentality_desc:0 "Pirates and raiders have long harassed the hyper lanes of the galaxy. We can learn from these scoundrels, and adopt their mindset if the situation calls for it."
fuel_and_weapon_escorts_desc:0 "While we will fight tooth and nail against our enemies, we can't neglect our own convoys. Fuel, weapons, and other military ordnances are the lifeblood of our fight. We must protect them."
heavy_weapon_platforms_desc:0 "We can hunt and raid larger targets with dedicated weapons platforms, allowing us to bring down even the biggest of fleets through asymmetric warfare."
concentrated_firepower_desc:0 "War is simple: You have more firepower, you win. If we can coordinate our fleets to concentrate their firepower in single targets, we can overpower anybody who stands in our way."
dedicated_large_carrier_support_desc:0 "While carriers are the primary component of our fleets, they can not act entirely independnetly. They will need ships dedicated to defense and support, which will in turn allow our carriers to more effectively do their missions."
corvette_and_gunship_superiority_desc:0 "Smaller ships, such as Gunships and Corvettes, are certainly important to our fight. We shall focus on their roles in combat, and use them to their fullest!"
snubfighter_supremacy_desc:0 "Snubfighters have been a part of our fleet since its inception, but with the state of the galaxy we must rely more and more on them."
simplified_communication_protocols_desc:0 "During the heat of combat, we can not trust that our pilots and admirals will remember each and every communication protocol laid down. With war in the galaxy at the forefront, we must streamline our communication protocols for ease of use."
light_torpedo_ships_desc:0 "Some slight adjustments to our torpedo ships will allow them to launch their torpedos much further into enemy lines, but require more time to reload before going in for another strike."
critical_subsystem_protection_desc:0 "All starships are run via subsystems that control everything on the ship. We must train our admirals and our gunners to be mindful of these positions in a bid to defend them as naturally and directly as possible. It could mean the difference between life and death."
promoted_air_and_naval_academies_desc:0 "While in the past, we could only afford minimal training for most of our pilots and admirals, we can no longer deny that the situation at hand has forced us to open our academies to every pilot and admiral in our ranks."
ground_to_air_command_desc:0 "Our admirals will work in much closer coordination with our generals. Wars may be fought in the skies, but once the war in the sky has ended we must not neglect the upsides of orbital bombardments."
concentrated_fields_of_fire_desc:0 "Slight adjustments to turrets will allow for greater cones of fire on our capital ships, allowing for more rapid target neutralization."
dedicated_refueling_ships_desc:0 "Refitting some of our support ships to become dedicated tankers will allow us to fight with more confidence wherever we are. Fuel is the blood of our fleet, we must not forget it."
weather_the_storm_desc:0 "Ever since Endor, people have been... more on edge. Morale in the ranks is dropping. But, no matter! We have been through worse! We will push on, and we shall weather whatever the galaxy sends at us!"
pinpoint_weaknesses_desc:0 "Every ship, every person, every state has a weakness. If we can find these, both on ourselves and the enemy fleets, and use them to our full advantage, we'll be able to rapidly take care of any threat to us/"
sacrifical_departments_desc:0 "Our cause is a noble one. Some departments on our ships will be put in the direct line of fire, and they must be okay with that. It is, after all, for the greater good."
use_of_interdictors_desc:0 "The enemy may try to run when our fleet comes down on top of them. We can not let them. They will stand and fight, and they will DIE!"
independent_task_force_desc:0 "We shall expand the structure of our navy once more, this time giving task forces more independence from Naval Command. Admirals and commanders can not make full use of what we give them if they are held back by bureaucracy."
attritional_containment_desc:0 "Our enemy may think themselves smart to hide away from us, yet they do not realize that they are playing into our hand. Once we have contained them, we will wear them down and eventually annihilate them."
logistical_strikes_desc:0 "Some may say that fuel and weapons are the lifeblood of a fight... yet, if you were to sever the stream of blood, our enemy would have no choice but to bleed out."
swarm_fighter_combat_desc:0 "Starfighters, in small numbers, are useless. They may harass and they may make precision strikes, but such things are useless to us. We must swarm our enemy with such an overwhelming force, that they have no chance to defend themselves."
experimental_storage_techniques_desc:0 "After Endor, we've lost control of most of our carriers. This has led to us having to... experiment with new storage techniques in our hangars to store the overabundance of snubfighters."
propaganda_and_disorentiating_munitions_desc:0 "Our snubfighters can be equipped with non-lethal weaponry, dropping propaganda and other demoralizing things onto the enemy in an attempt to shatter their organization and morale."
interlocked_escort_ships_desc:0 "While escort ships would often form a "wall" against enemy ships, with some tweaking this wall can become a literal wall, interlocking our escorts with each other and convoys to protect them even more against attacks by raiders."
combined_tractor_beam_operations_desc:0 "In a post-Endor war, we must use any and every tool at our disposal. Even our tractor beams can be used to our advantage, especially while raiding enemy convoys. It is much easier for our ships to hit a sitting target, than a moving one."
massed_air_strikes_desc:0 "Coordination between pilots and flight command will allow for precision strikes in the same area, leading to the ability to annihilate specific targets or locations with a few passovers."
conservation_of_materials_desc:0 "With supply lines and resources at such a precarious position, we need to preserve anything we currently have. It is better to retreat and fight another day, than to lose a capital ship."
quantity_based_quotas_desc:0 "We must tighten our belts, and exploit what we have to an even greater extent! The people must join in our war via intense quotas for them to fulfill under the threat of punishment."
a_new_era_of_warfare_navy_tree_desc:0 "Years ago, the Empire's hold over the galaxy was shattered at Endor. The Emperor was dead, and the future was uncertain. Yet, throughout it all, we have survived and stood against our enemies. Endor is now but a memory in people's minds, and the future of warfare stands in front of us."
deployable_decoy_aircraft_desc:0 "We have begun to deploy decoy starfighters to coax out and better locate the enemy starfighters in dogfights."
underdog_fighting_desc:0 "Despite our position in the galaxy being more secure than it was several years ago, our position as an underdog has remained. We must never forget the tactics we've had to rely on in the past."
far_afield_raiders_desc:0 "Our daring raids on convoys in the past have lent themselves well to our current position, giving us the experience we need to precisely strike far away buildings and military targets with only a few bombers."
nova_flare_desc:0 "A new tactic taken from the Galactic Civil War, a squadron of starfighters can overwhelm and knock out capital ships via a massive barrage of missiles or torpedoes aimed at key points on the shields."
concentrated_focus_desc:0 "If our navy works in closer coordination with each other, strikes and missions can be pulled off more efficiently with a concentrated focus."
specialized_air_units_desc:0 "Air units shall be broken down into further specializations to better respond to and deal with enemy fighters during dogfights."
gunship_support_craft_desc:0 "The war on the ground is just as important as the war in the sky! Our gunships will work closer with ground command to better support them, with bombing runs and CAS training for all gunship pilots."
mini_hyperspace_jumps_desc:0 "While hyperspace jumps have usually been used to jump from one planet to the next, we've been able to fine tune our hyperdrives to perform shorter jumps, usually within the system itself, to quickly move around and respond quicker."
intentional_lack_of_stability_desc:0 "Lack of control over the starfighter has been a fear of pilots for generations, but if our pilots were trained to intentionally lose stability but maintain control of the fighters... no manuever would be out of reach for them."
air_spotter_craft_desc:0 "Dogfights are rapid and scary, with the pilots often riding on a knife's edge between life and death. If we were to field lightly armed crafts that would both spot and assist our fighters in target acquisition, one of the most difficult parts of dogfights could be eliminated."
integrated_astromech_maneuvers_desc:0 "Integrating astromechs with our starfighters nav computers would allow our fighters to pull off more precise and dangerous manuevers with less training to the pilots."
devoted_ramming_ships_desc:0 "Ramming has been known to cause devestating effects, both intentionally and unintentionally. If we bulk up some of our ship designs and give them more internal structure, they could easily ram enemy ships with no fear."
a_grand_battle_fleet_desc:0 "The days of ragtag, rustbucket fleets is gone. We now stand at the helm of one of the most powerful galactic navies of our time. This is something to be celebrated."
forward_shield_specalised_recon_desc:0 "Departments in the frontal shields of our ships can be used for special recon and target acquisition, leading to quicker engagements between capital ships."
way_station_patrols_desc:0 "Patrols hailing from our waystations that are considered to be more rural may alert us to threats and ships earlier than other sensors or fleets."
duo_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "One fighter is rapidly picked off by another, yet two fighters will always have a fighting chance. We will begin to pair up two fighters to guard each other and watch each other's backs."
impenetrable_shield_desc:0 "Advancements in shielding has led to some deeming our shields "impenetrable." In reality, they're not... but the extra strength is nice."
decoy_torpedo_signals_desc:0 "In a time when most ships have sensors that have the ability to detect torpedos, we've developed a signal that can be sent out from smaller starships that will mimic the signal of a torpedo, and set off the sensors on enemy ships."
assigned_sister_ships_desc:0 "We have further developed our coordination tactics by taking after the proposed "Duo Fighter Doctrine" to assign sister ships to capital ships, creating more fleet cohesion and organization."
sticky_munition_desc:0 "While perhaps not actually "stick" per se, these munitions have localized targeting computers that allow them to correct near-misses on the fly and hit the intended target."
using_their_size_against_them_desc:0 "Our enemies seem to think that bigger, heavier ships will always beat out smaller, more coordinated fleets. We should use this to our advantage, and use their bloated, disorganized fleets to confuse and run circles around them."
a_end_of_terror_desc:0 "A dream of trillions has finally been realized. The Galaxy has begun to heal, and the darkest, most uncertain days are behind us. It is time to look toward the future, and protect not only our people, but the galaxy's people with our modern, tactically superior fleet."

########Land Doctrines Descriptions########

post_endor_survival_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, be it victory or defeat, Endor is behind us now. Let us prepare for the coming challenges, and decide on the new path we shall forge through the galaxy."
new_horizons_desc:0 "The game of cat and mouse across the stars has violently exploded into yet another galaxy-spanning war. While those involved are busy fighting for their lives, we must dig in and prepare. Our time is still ahead of us."
careful_surveillance_desc:0 "Sitting idly by won't do us any good, nor will revealing our intentions to the galaxy. Any incursion outside of our borders must be thoroughly planned and carefully executed."
a_taste_of_our_power_desc:0 "The time has come to reveal ourselves. However, we must not be too bold, nor too brash. Decisive strikes shall reveal our power, while hiding our capabilities."
retaliatory_strikes_desc:0 "While we are on the backfoot, we should not forget those who strike us in our weakened state. Riposte strikes will allow us to save ourselves from continued assaults, and maintain our status for the time being."
emergency_defensive_planning_desc:0 "While any hope for retaking what we have lost is effectively gone, we shouldn't so readily throw away what we still have. We must dig in, and fight those terrorists tooth and nail."
AT_AT_superiority_desc:0 "The hulking AT-AT was designed as a transport, but with proper usage it is a formidable weapon in any role. Combined with the psychological effect it has on it's opponents, it will become the bulwark of our new empire."
take_out_the_incomptent_desc:0 "Perhaps in times of peace we can put up with incompetence and slackers, but when our mere existence is on a razor's edge, there is no room for failure. No room for incompetence..."
old_guard_training_desc:0 "While the veterans of the Civil War have experience, you can still teach an old Akk dog new tricks."
take_back_our_control_desc:0 "Those big shots fighting their Civil War have forced us to the backburner. Perhaps it's time we strike back and remind them who we are..."
take_advantage_of_new_markets_desc:0 "War means business! And when the galaxy is burning, somebody's got to sell some flame dousers."
expansion_of_mercs_desc:0 "There's a neverending stream of young and strong thrill seekers looking to fight our wars for us in exchange for a little bit of credits or a cut of the loot."
reachout_to_traitors_desc:0 "Disillusioned officers, rogue pilots, AWOL soldiers... there's an untapped market of people seeking safety and a cause to fight for. If we give them both, we can turn them against their old allies."
decticated_support_units_desc:0 "Mercecenaries aren't all magical. They need mechanics to work on their weapons, hospitals to patch them up, artillery brigades to bomb out the enemy. If we provide these services, we can get even more out of our investments."
creative_financing_desc:0 "In times of war, who's really reading all those tax reports, anyway? And checking where all of our income comes from? If we use such loopholes to our advantage, our coffers will be full for anything to come."
large_scale_warfare_desc:0 "In the past, our partisans and soldiers fought dirty, with small-scale operations or non-traditional tactics. These tactics have no place in a war to reclaim the entire galaxy, and we must pivot to accept this reality."
keep_true_to_our_roots_desc:0 "While the Civil War is mostly waged in massive battles and full frontal combat, we must never forget our local, grassroots operatives who brought us to this point."
mid_rim_disaster_desc:0 "Memories of the Mid Rim Retreat echo in our veterans heads. It wasn't too long ago we were bogged down far from the core. We must not let that happen again, and push through no matter the cost."
peace_for_our_citzens_desc:0 "Our citizens no longer toil under the boot of Imperial authority. We can't bring the war into their homes the same way the Empire did. Our citizens will know peace, even while we fight."
strategical_air_supremacy_desc:0 "Our navy is growing fast, but we still can't control every air space. We should use our limited resources to fight and hold air spaces that will be strategically important."
lessons_of_peace_desc:0 "War rages all around us... but why should we care? Why should we militarize ourselves to go into the fray. Our people are safe and happy, let us keep it that way."
prepare_for_anything_desc:0 "Despite our reluctance to join the fighting, that does not strictly mean the fighting won't just come to us. We must prepare for our own safety in any case."
professional_forces_desc:0 "Bunkers and shields are good defenses, but the people that will fight and die to defend us need only the best training available, and nothing less."
promoted_creativity_desc:0 "Creativity on the battlefield is one of the most important skills a soldier can have. It is time we begin promoting such creative individuals to positions of power."
remove_unwanted_personnel_desc:0 "Not everybody within our military is required for our cause, we should only keep the most loyal and resolute in our military, even if it means less soldiers overall."
lessons_of_endor_desc:0 "Studying the Battle of Endor, the Rebellion's usage of small, independent strike squads and non-traditional tactics is what clearly won the day in the end. Such a doctrine is applicable to our situation, as well. \n\n"
priotised_key_sites_desc:0 "Our artillery brigages should focus on specific sites of key military importance and wipe them out with an array of explosives. This should paralyze the enemies, while keeping our soldiers safe."
recon_and_survillence_units_desc:0 "Our recon units are key to our success on the battlefield. Our strike teams will be even more successful with proper knowledge of situations they're going in to."
play_to_the_terrain_desc:0 "Knowing when to dig in, when to set up traps and let the enemy come to you, and how to traverse any terrain will allow our fighters to be effectively unstoppable by the elements that would otherwise stop an army in it's tracks."
special_forces_academies_desc:0 "What's the worth of all of our doctrines if we are unable to teach them to our fledgling fighters? We should open academies dedicated to guerilla warfare and non-traditional fighting."
live_for_another_fight_desc:0 "Our enemies will often be fielding much larger, more oppressive armies over us. The only thing we have over them is that we can pick and choose our fights. To die for the cause is honorable, but to live and fight another day for it is more practical."
dreams_of_corusant_desc:0 "Coruscant... the Queen of the Core. Whoever holds the planet, holds leadership of the galaxy, if only in name. May that glimmering gem inspire our soldiers to fight harder, so that one day they may reclaim it for our cause. \n\n"
breach_and_conquer_desc:0 "When fighting against millions of opposing soldiers, only two things matter: Firepower to make holes in their flanks, and speed to exploit such holes."
bomber_command_desc:0 "Our ground and air units working together closely will allow for much easier target acquisition, for both our ground units and bombers."
fleet_liaisons_desc:0 "If our fleets provide liaisons to our military, the military will be able to make use of far more resources and firepower in their plans; especially in the department of planetary invasions."
strategical_command_superiority_desc:0 "Grand battleplans and operations across entire star systems will be vital to our victory. We must all fight as one in favor of the bigger picture."
aggression_at_all_costs_desc:0 "Wars aren't won by sitting idly by or defending our home. They are won by brutally and unrelentlessly annihilating the enemy, no matter the cost. \n\n"
off_handed_attack_desc:0 "Even when not in position, or while retreating, our soldiers must be expected to attack and be prepared to attack, even if it only does minimal damage."
national_phobia_desc:0 "We should stoke the fires of fear and hatred for our enemies within our people. Any successful war is carried off the backs of the people, and their support will be invaluable."
drop_missions_desc:0 "Dropping specifically trained troops behind enemy lines will cause havoc and encircle the enemies before they have a chance to react to our brazen assault."
infiltration_of_their_lines_desc:0 "While risky and not for the faint of heart, sending Infiltration missions to appear where the enemy least expects us could be what we need to turn the tide in battles."
tactical_command_superiority_desc:0 "Tactics on the ground are what will win out in the end. The most secure of plans will fall apart the moment it reaches a battlefield, so we should do everything in our power to win on the battlefield."

combined_armoured_support_desc:0 "Our armored units shall support and be supported by movements made by our other armored crafts. A single armored craft can easily be overrun, but multiple can support each other. \n\n"
 two_tap_bombing_desc:0 "Two rapid shots back-to-back on a single target can be more effective against clustered targets, barely giving them a moment to respond, however our units will have to keep on the move to pull off such a manuever."
 attached_mechanised_units_desc:0 "Mechanized units have proved their worth over ground infantry. If we embrace this obvious supremacy and integrate such mechanized units to our ground infantry, they will be well protected and unstoppable."
 unified_radio_delegation_desc:0 "Planning between units and singular crafts is mandatory for certain manuevers. However, such planning could be streamlined if it could be done directly to units, rather than through a central command comlink."
independant_command_structure_desc:0 "The command structure of our military shall be expanded, opening much more flexibility between divisions. However, for this we shall sacrifice coordination between our units and divisions."
behind_the_sabre_desc:0 "While tanks may be the vanguard of our military, we can not forget those who come in afterward and secure the area afterward. Even if not on the frontlines, they should be able to hold the line on their own."
lighting_strike_desc:0 "Our armored crafts can ignore their engine's limits and momentarily move at speeds that the enemy won't expect. However, these vehicles will guzzle gas and be left in disrepair if our supply lines were to be cut off."
raiding_operations_desc:0 "Our infantry in lightly armored vehicles have the speed and capabilities to strike the enemy to capture equipment and harass the enemies while unprepared."
new_droid_logistical_units_desc:0 "Droids have long been used for military purposes. Cold, efficient, and programmed for the perfect option, logistic droids shall solve any and all logistical issues."

overwhelming_numbers_desc:0 "Three of our soldiers for every one of theirs. Our soldiers won't need as much training or any fancy 'equipment', but their sheer numbers will be overwhelming and unyielding."
trial_by_fire_desc:0 "Our recruits are unneeded to us if they can not hold their own and survive a baptism of gunfire and death. This mindset should extend to our commanders, as well. If they are unable to keep calm under fatal situations, what use are they?"
versatile_engineering_desc:0 "Our loyal soldiers will experience a vast array of situations and terrain. The least we can do for them is provide equipment prepared for any situation."
new_academies_desc:0 "Training is expensive, but will allow for application of all of our doctrines more effectively. As well, our units shall be able to retain more of what they learn in the battlefield even beyond the halls of our academies."
freedom_of_the_common_man_desc:0 "Our people have tasted freedom, liberty, and happiness... and they shall never go back to the alternative. Our people are prepared to fight and die for their freedom.\n\n"
order_to_the_galaxy_desc:0 "The chaos of the Civil War have reached every corner of the galaxy, and it is our job to fight this chaos back and return order wherever required.\n\n"
new_military_judcial_courts_desc:0 "War crimes were commited en masse by both sides in the wars that have engulfed the galaxy in the last two decades. It would be wrong to deny these happened, or to forgive any responsible. They shall all stand trial."
stashed_weapons_desc:0 "Old stashes from the Civil War, to new ones put together in preparation for the inevitable... it is time for our people to take up these hidden arms against their new oppressors."
underground_training_desc:0 "Back in the Civil War, the Rebellion trained their insurgents via irregular means. Behind enemy lines, our people will be taught the same tactics to resist and harass the occupying forces."
years_of_insurgencys_desc:0 "Our people have spent years upon years hidden away like a Black Nexu waiting to strike... and strike they have, and strike they will. Such people have unique skillsets as insurgents, and are prepared to enter the fray against the new invaders once again."
denationalisation_process_desc:0 "Despite controlling their territory, the citizens of our enemies still see themselves as loyal to a government that isn't ours. We should begin to convert these people, into our people."
