Since the death of Emperor Palpatine, the Empire has become fractured, and Pestage wishes to prevent further division by allowing all those leaders still loyal to the New Order to have a say in the Empire's future. \n\nThree proposals have been made:\nFirst, by Admiral Zsinj, who proposes that all imperial states should fund the self-declared Warlords as their primary means of defence.\nSecond, by Grand Moff Ardus Kaine, who proposes that Imperial states adopt a common trade policy.\nThird, by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who proposes that research be subsidized and the main priority of the Empire.\n\nHow do we stand?"

EMP.16.d:0 "Ysanne Isard, Director of Imperial Intelligence and architect of the coup which ousted Imperial 'Leader' Sate Pestage in favor of the Imperial Ruling Council, had grown disillusioned with their rule. Last night on imperial center, sounds of screaming and blaster fire could be heard over the groaning of coruscanti traffic, as agents loyal to Isard performed the assassination of every single member of the Imperial Ruling Council! Their heads were delivered to Isard's office this morning. An announcement was broadcast declaring that the Council was planning treason against the Empire and were therefore imprisoned.

EMP.18:0 "The Breaking Point"
EMP.18.d:0 "In light of the recent open disobedience towards his government, Emperor Sate Pestage has declared that all Imperial agents are to report for questioning as to their true loyalties. The interrogations have proven long and arduous, and Pestage's sadistic tendencies have made many officers hesitant to believe that the Emperor will grant them amnesty should they notify him of information pertaining to subversive activites within Imperial circles. However, the Emperor and his trusted advisors have now been able to track down the source of many of the political machinations currently spinning on Imperial City: a plot led by the Imperial Ruling Council and Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard to forcefully overthrow Pestage and take control of the Empire themselves! Pestage has now formulated his own plan... to rid the Empire of these traitors once and for all! But is he too late?"
EMP.19:0 "Ysanne Isard sends her Regards"
EMP.19.d:0 "Galactic Empress Ysanne Isard has sent us a communication stating that she wishes to send several Imperial officers to the Unknown Regions so that they may gain valued experience in our service.

EMP.20:0 "Rogue Squadron Compromised"
EMP.20.d:0 "Ysanne Isard has apparently hatched a plot to infiltrate and destroy our heroic Rogue Squadron, though the leaders of the squadrons managed to survive her awful plans, we lost many valuable pilots to her. She must be stopped one way or another!"

EMP.24:0 "The Warlords Declare Independence"
EMP.24.d:0 "Due to the lack of an Emperor or central authority within the Empire, several leading Moffs and Admirals have halted all troop transfers from their sectors, and consolidated their own authority. Some consider them traitors while some consider them to merely do what is right to continue to the reign of the empire, whatever it actually is, they are no longer under our control."
EMP.25:0 "Lack of Central Imperial Authority"
EMP.25.d:0 "Due to the lack of an Emperor or central authority within the Empire, many star systems have effectively begun to ignore any orders from Coruscant.
