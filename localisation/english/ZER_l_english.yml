 ZER_blitzer_harrsk_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk was one of the most talented tacticians in the Imperial Navy. During the Battle of Endor, Harrsk suffered a cranial injury resulting in a split personality between Harrsk and his deceased second-in-command Captain Bolla Thoath. Following the destruction of the death star, Harrsk, who was convinced he was Bolla Thoath, initially complied with Captain Gilad Pellaeon's retreat orders. Harrsk later emerged from his second personality and refused to obey orders from such a low rank imperial.\n\nIn the past 2 years since the Emperor was killed, Harrsk has carved out the an empire in the Deep Core using his fleet of modified star destroyers. The self-proclaimed Lord High Admiral Harrsk now looks to expand the influence of the Zero Command and forge a new Empire in the ashes of a dying one."

 ZER_empire_reformation.1.t:0 "Storming the Imperial Palace!"
 ZER_empire_reformation.1.d:0 "Harrsk strode up the ruined steps of the Imperial Palace, dead stormtroopers lay on either side of him, large craters riddled the sides of the Palace. Following behind the Admiral were members of his personal guard, symbols of his status. As he reached the door of the Palace, Harrsk turned to his guard and ordered them to kill every Imperial inside the building.\n\nRed flashes of light, explosions, and cries of pain rattled the windows of the Palace as the defenders of the building were cut down swiftly. One of Harrsk's guards returned to the door where Harrsk stood with the remainder of his forces, he indicated that it was safe to enter and the defenders had been defeated.\n\nThe Lord High Admiral entered the palace, walked to the administrative office of the Chancellor, and entered the dark room. There was no one inside the room despite the presence of two dead guardsmen outside the door. It appears as if the Emperor had left, escaping the grasps of Harrsk, but this fact did little to discourage Blitzer Harrsk; he had won, he had reclaimed Coruscant for the true Galactic Empire and was ready to proclaim a new era of Imperial domination.\n\nAs he exited the palace, his guards formed two lines outside the door. He began his descent down the stairs and as soon as he took his first step his guards started to chant 'Long live the Emperor!'' and 'Power to the Empire!'\n\nAs his warships flew above his head, Harrsk knew this was it. He was the Emperor."
 ZER_empire_reformation.1.a:0 "Emperor at last."

 ZER_start.2.a:0 "This is madness!"
 ZER_start.2.b:0 "It's simply a security measure."

 ZER.1.t:0 "Zero Command Fleet Modifications?"
 ZER.1.d:0 "Never before has Zero Command faced more external threats! Lord High Admiral Harrsk requires a more powerful fleet in order to protect our territories from potential enemies. We have two feasible options; we could either technologically enhance our current ships, or set about creating an efficient production line for new warships. A technologically advanced fleet enjoys precision in tactics, low losses, and high impact on the battlefield. A larger, standardised fleet enjoys strength in numbers and less material loss when a fleet is destroyed. The choice is up to you commander."
 ZER.1.a:0 "A technologically enhanced fleet will give us the advantage."
 ZER.1.b:0 "Zero Command requires more warships to defend itself."

 ZER.2.t:0 "Robotic Tie Fighters"
 ZER.2.d:0 "Our scientists have been experimenting with robotically assisted Tie Fighters, although they have been extremely effective at targeting enemies and navigating obstacles, the pilots usually have to intervene as the tests have shown but if this technology succeeds, it could give us the edge over our enemy. Final tests will determine whether the technology is battle-ready or not."
 ZER.2.a:0 "I'm hoping for results..."

 ZER.3.t:0 "Testing Failure"
 ZER.3.d:0 "The testing Tie Fighters were unable to pass the course provided by the researchers, the project has been terminated but some valuable experience has been gained by many of the fleet technicians."
 ZER.3.a:0 "It was a crazy idea anyways!"

 ZER.4.t:0 "Testing Success"
 ZER.4.d:0 "Miraculously the tests were all passed by the robotic Tie Fighters, although this technology will not be used to fully control spacecraft it will be implemented in newer models of Tie Fighter to improve the pilot's accuracy and provide a competent autopilot."
 ZER.4.a:0 "Let's hope our enemies don't find this."

 ZER.5.t:0 "Shockwave Battle-ready"
 ZER.5.d:0 "Shockwave has been completely sealed with all new additions fixed to the warship. The destroyer must go through a series of inspections before being implemented. Lord High Admiral Harrsk is elated with the completion of this project and is keen to unveil the machine of war to the public."
 ZER.5.a:0 "Excellent!"

 ZER.6.t:0 "Shockwave Revealed to the Public"
 ZER.6.d:0 "The technologically advanced star destroyer Shockwave was revealed to the public today amidst a military parade. The behemoth of a warship hovered peacefully in the sky above rows of marching stormtroopers. Looks of amazement and astonishment were seen on the citizens's faces as they looked up to such a sight."
 ZER.6.a:0 "A most powerful weapon."

 ZER.7.t:0 "Tie Fighter Malfunctions"
 ZER.7.d:0 "The Tie Fighter was designed by the Empire as an efficient starfighter. Featuring no hyperdrive and minimal life support, the design of the fighter is barebones at best. Our pilots have routinely been victims of malfunctions, impairing them in the heat of battle. Only recently a skirmish took place between Zero Command forces and a small band of smugglers. What should have been an easy victory turned to a humiliation as one of the pilot's Tie Fighter malfunctioned causing a collision with most of his wingmates. We must resolve these issues if we intend to use these fighters en masse in future conflicts."

He proposes a military alliance with the intent of uniting the Imperial factions once more. Although the self-proclaimed Lord High Admiral has noble intentions, it may be unwise to join forces with Harrsk without guarantees of independence.\n\nThe High Command of Zero Command has offered protection and support in our future wars in exchange for our support in their goal to retake the galaxy against the rebel threat."
 ZER_start.12.a:0 "A worthy cause!"
 ZER_start.12.b:0 "It is too dangerous."

 ZER_news.1.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk, leader of the Imperial splinter faction Zero Command has announced that he has been promoted to Lord High Admiral. He intends to use this new position to grow the influence of Zero Command throughout the inner core. Many imperial and rebel leaders are skeptical of the legitimacy of this promotion, including Leia Organa who stated that she suspects he gave the rank to himself. Despite the strange rank that Harrsk has been promoted to, celebrations have erupted on Zero Command's capital world of Kalist VI and there has been a surge in popular support for the warlord."

Lord High Admiral Blitzer Harrsk has risen in support until his power outweighed that of [?global.previous_emperor.GetLeader]. Harrsk vows to restore the Empire to its former might no matter the cost. He promises death to the rebellion and any who sympathise with them. Emperor Blitzer Harrsk announced that Zero Command and a collection of other loyal warlords would be reorganised into the Imperial Remnant with the goal of retaking the former capital of the Galactic Empire on Coruscant. The new Emperor states that only once the rebellion has been exterminated from Coruscant can a new Galactic Empire be established."

 ZER_news.3.desc:0 "Lord High Admiral Blitzer Harrsk has declared that he has begun the Imperial Crusade to liberate Coruscant and bring the seat of the Galactic Empire's power back to the true successors to the Imperial throne. Thousands of warships and armies of stormtroopers have been assembled in neighboring systems to prepare for the assault. If this invasion succeeds, the Galaxy will enter a new era of Imperial control. Harrsk states that his ambition is to form one unified Empire under himself and eventually rid the Galaxy of its impurities."

 ZER_news.4.desc:0 "Zero Command has invaded the Imperial world of Fondor with the intent of integrating it into its new Galactic Empire. Although they will meet fierce resistance on the surface, there are many loyal to Zero Command on Fondor who have risen up to fight the current administration. Is this the start of a new era for Zero Command? Or will it end up as a humiliating defeat for the Lord High Admiral."

 ZER_start.8.d:0 "With the surrender of Abregado Rae's planetary government, it seems that insurgents from other parts of the galaxy have encouraged the populace to rebel against our new government. Although the occupation of the planet is in its infancy, if left unchecked, the insurgency problem may become a future issue.\n\nCentral command has provided two strategies for defending our interests on Abregado Rae. The first dictates that we defend the main cities and areas that sustain our forces on the planet, this would protect our areas of interest but would give way for rebellion to grow in areas that are not being defended by our forces. The second strategy is a methodical sweep of the planet for insurgents and a large contingent of imperial soldiers and stormtroopers on the planet to prevent future rebellion. Although the second option would most likely deal with the resistance problem quickly, large quantities of equipment and manpower would be needed to deal with the issue. Alternatively we could also install a small garrison and leave the resistance cells to subsist over time."
 ZER_start.8.a:0 "Defend our interests on the planet."
 ZER_start.8.b:0 "Crush the rebels now!"
 ZER_start.8.c:0 "We must preserve our resources."

 ZER_start.9.t:0 "Attack on Weapons Depot"

 ZER_start.9.a:0 "Rebel scum."

 ZER_start.10.t:0 "Large Scale Uprising"
 ZER_start.10.d:0 "Rebellion has sparked in Abregado Rae! Although not escalated to a full military conflict, the workers of factories in the cities of Abregado Rae have striked against their factory managers and have begun destroying equipment and pursuing lone imperial officers. This insolence must not be tolerated, the high command suggests that we kill every one of them."
 ZER_start.10.a:0 "They will be dealt with in due time."

 ZER_start.11.t:0 "Harrsk convenes with High Command"
 ZER_start.11.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk walks into the strategic room on the upper deck of his flagship Tector-class Star Destroyer. His high command and strategic advisors are present in the room in their imperial officer uniforms. The air in the room is tense as the officers know the decision Harrsk is about to announce, a few officers had even placed bets on Harrsk's decisions.\n\nThe Lord High Admiral of Zero Command sits in the tall leather seat at the end of the strategic room's conference table. He places his datapad on the table, clears his voice and says 'Thank you my most loyal soldiers, paladins of Imperial faith, protectors of peace and order. Today I have made a decision, for better or for worse, I believe it is in the best interest of Zero Command.'\n\nTension rose in the room as Harrsk prepared to announce his decision: 'It is time to gear for war! Zero Command will pursue its goal…'"

 ZER_start.14.a:0 "Let them arrive."

 ZER_start.15.t:0 "Deep 3 is Complete!"
 ZER_start.15.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk swiftly moved through the hallways of the Shockwave, paying no attention to the lowly officers and guards that walked by him. Harrsk was excited, he was ready to show the galaxy what he could really do. The Lord High Admiral reached the end of the corridor, walked into the hangar, and boarded a Lambda Class T-4a shuttle that would take him to Deep 3.\n\nOn arrival in Deep 3's main hangar, Harrsk is greeted by a line of Stormtroopers and a group of scientists. The scientists bring him to the Northern control room where he meets an old friend Rena Tille. She explains that Deep 3 is fully functional and she has teams of scientists working on projects ranging from robotically piloted tie fighters, plasma fusion cannons, and blast resistant stormtrooper armor. Harrsk begins staring out of one window at a group of scientists who were occupied with fixing a robotic human implant. Tille was concerned and asked the admiral if he was alright.\n\nHarrsk replied 'This is just what Zero Command needs-'"

 ZER_start.17.a:0 "Wonderful."

 ZER_start.18.t:0 "The Minor Warlords bend a knee"
 ZER_start.18.d:0 "The petty Imperial warlords of the Deep Core have been subjugated through force, their forces have joined our ranks and their officers are now established in our hierarchy.

 ZER_start.19.t:0 "A Forboding Transmission"
 ZER_start.19.d:0 "Lord High Admiral Harrsk was relaxing after a long day of diplomacy with foreign ambassadors and garnering support from the Galaxy's elite. Suddenly the hologram in front of him flickered to life, the hologram was of [var:global.emperor_id.GetLeader] warning Harrsk that he would be destroyed if he challenged the rule of the true Galactic Empire any further.

 ZER_warlord.1.t:0 "Changes to Administration"
 ZER_warlord.1.d:0 "Zero Command has only recently been formed. This simple fact has led to many problems in the administration of its territory. Officers often become corrupt and refuse to follow orders from higher ranks, we must crush this behaviour. We must decide whether to include everyone in our war efforts or if we should exclude some, less helpful, officers."
 ZER_warlord.1.a:0 "Remove the disobedient officers."
 ZER_warlord.1.b:0 "Reduce their ranks."

 ZER_warlord.2.t:0 "The KBS Conference"
 ZER_warlord.2.d:0 "'Welcome to the first KBS conference!' the announcer said cheerfully.\n\nBlitzer Harrsk knew this meeting was important for maintaining the stability of Zero Command but his mind drifted off to other subjects such as the development of his arms manufactories and other military dealings. His mind quickly snapped back to focus as the announcer displayed his plans for the new Kalist Banking System. The man explained that he wanted to create a bank that was independently owned and ran by citizens of Zero Command.\n\nHarrsk was not sure this idea appealed to him as he wanted to have complete control over the banks. Government control over the monetary system would be preferable for him because of the efficiency of taxation. Although, he must also maintain a free market to fulfill his idea of an independent haven in the core of the galaxy. Harrsk deliberated on the way back to his residency and finally came to the conclusion that..."
 ZER_warlord.2.a:0 "...a private bank would be best."
 ZER_warlord.2.b:0 "...government control is needed."

 ZER_warlord.3.t:0 "The Execution of Treuten Teradoc"
 ZER_warlord.3.d:0 "Treuten Teradoc, a former Imperial warlord and rival of Harrsk, was brought to Harrsk's palace in Kalist City. The stormtrooper guards dragged him in front of the Lord High Admiral and Harrsk threw everything in his hands to the table in front of him. He succumbed to rage and shouted unintelligible insults towards Admiral Treuten. The advisor next to Harrsk whispered something into his ear 'We should feed him to the rancor–he deserves it!'"
 ZER_warlord.3.a:0 "Give him a merciful death."

Being one of the greatest tacticians in the galaxy and a staunch supporter of the Imperial cause, It is time for Harrsk to have a new title! The emperor has not recognised us and therefore won't bestow the rank of Grand Moff to Harrsk. The rank of Lord High Admiral will have to suffice."

 ZER_abregado_rupture:0 "The Abregado Rupture"
 ZER_abregado_rupture_desc:0 "The conquest of Abregado Rae was a tough battle; guerilla tactics and support from generous rebel donors combatted our superior military and doctrine. Future conquests will be fought in similar ways and we must develop a capability to counter guerilla tactics. Successful officers will be promoted to generals and their tactical suggestions will be taken into account when forging new strategies."

 ZER_death_to_dissidents:0 "Death to Dissidents"
 ZER_death_to_dissidents_desc:0 "Although the planetary government of Abregado Rae has officially surrendered to our forces, the planet is large and angry citizens and brigands alike continue to skirmish with our forces. We have two main options: fortify the cities and areas that provide us with the most benefit or continue a military occupation of the planet to prevent future rebellion."

 ZER_crossroads_of_destiny:0 "Crossroads of Destiny"
 ZER_crossroads_of_destiny_desc:0 "High command is pleased with the conquest of Abregado Rae, but that is only the first step in forging Zero Command as an imperial power. We are at a crossroads, high command is split on whether Zero Command should pursue a goal of becoming a successor to the Empire, which would involve years of hard fighting with not only the Rebellion but other imperial factions, or to forge our own independent domain using Imperial technology."

 ZER_a_warlord_economy:0 "A Warlord Economy"
 ZER_a_warlord_economy_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetName]'s economy is severely struggling, being born from fractions of a dissolving Empire, many of the vehicles, facilities, and equipment left behind are outdated or in disrepair. The first step in curing the rapid decrease in wealth seen in the nation is to restart the industry that used to be located in our territory."

 ZER_invest_in_new_manufactories:0 "Invest in New Manufactories"
 ZER_invest_in_new_manufactories_desc:0 "Kalist VI is littered with outdated, run-down facilities that produce unwanted low-quality products. We must invest in new equipment and facilities to produce higher quality goods that markets want to buy. This economic step will be expensive but is required to provide new jobs and wealth to our people."

 ZER_expand_the_jamaara_shipyards:0 "Expand the Jamaara Shipyards"
 ZER_expand_the_jamaara_shipyards_desc:0 "Since the formation of Zero Command in 4 ABY, the Jamaara Shipyards have provided us with the facilities to produce warships at a quality that competes with many larger Imperial splinter factions. The Jamaara shipyard facilities will be expanded to cope with future increases in our need to manufacture warships."

 ZER_focus_on_concentrated_industry:0 "Concentrated Industry"

 ZER_expand_the_kalist_iv_mines_desc:0 "The mines of Kalist VI have provided its occupiers with resources such as durasteel and rhydonium for millenia, it is only natural that we seek to expand the mines with the goal of increasing our exports and acquiring precious resources for expanding our influence."

 ZER_interplanetary_economics:0 "Interplanetary Economics"

 ZER_reversal_of_fates:0 "Reversal of Fates"
 ZER_reversal_of_fates_desc:0 "Zero Command, being the first 'warlord' kingdom to form in the wake of the Emperor's death, is an odd contender to the Imperial throne. Many Imperial factions may not believe our intentions and distrust sown by Harrsk in the months after the Emperor's death will complicate our ascension to Emperor."

 ZER_spreading_propaganda:0 "Spreading Propaganda"
 ZER_spreading_propaganda_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk is not the most popular Imperial officer in the galaxy, far from it in actuality. We must garner the support of the people! If Imperial citizens view Harrsk as the Empire's saviour, the Imperial officer who can defend the Core worlds from the Rebel threat, then his influence will not only grow in our territory but around the galaxy."

 ZER_legitimacy_with_power:0 "Legitimacy with Power"
 ZER_legitimacy_with_power_desc:0 "While the support behind Harrsk in his quest to become emperor is insignificant, we have other ways of garnering support. The Empire, in its struggle against the rebelscum, is unable to contend with the large armies of the New Republic. To unite the Imperial factions we must maintain a strong military, one capable of defending our territory from the New Republic."

 ZER_imperial_diplomatic_missions:0 "Imperial Diplomatic Missions"
 ZER_imperial_diplomatic_missions_desc:0 "Alone we do not have the strength to compete with the New Republic or many of the larger Imperial warlords.

 ZER_the_fondor_coup:0 "The Fondor Coup"
 ZER_the_fondor_coup_desc:0 "The neighboring planet of Fondor, a large shipbuilding world which has been weathering Rebel assaults and skirmishes, has grown tired of the leadership on their planet. The inability of [FON.GetLeader]'s forces to defeat the New Republic has spread fear amongst the people. We will simply assume command as a higher ranking officer of the Imperial navy."

 ZER_tapani_financial_support:0 "Tapani Financial Support"

 ZER_imperial_symbology:0 "Imperial Symbology"
 ZER_imperial_symbology_desc:0 "The symbols of the Zero Command, although in their infancy, may be to the distaste of many Imperial factions whom we wish to unite. Donning the Imperial sigil and adopting Imperial symbology on our military vehicles and uniforms will provide us with more legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

 ZER_supporters_across_the_galaxy:0 "Supporters Across the Galaxy"
 ZER_supporters_across_the_galaxy_desc:0 "With our influence over the Empire slowly improving, we are able to garner support from Imperial factions across the galaxy. Envoys and diplomats will be sent to Imperial warlords to convince them of our cause and guarantee a strong, unified Imperial body when the time comes to dethrone the pretend Emperor and wage a new war against the rebel scum!"

 ZER_appealing_to_deserters:0 "Appealing to Deserters"
 ZER_appealing_to_deserters_desc:0 "In the years following the Battle of Endor, legions of stormtroopers and fleets of star destroyers have abandoned their commanding officers and are now roaming the galaxy as petty brigands. Many of these soldiers still feel an allegiance towards the Empire, we must unite the Imperials if we are to defeat the scum of the Galaxy."

 ZER_our_economic_accomplishment:0 "Our Economic Accomplishment"
 ZER_our_economic_accomplishment_desc:0 "Many Imperial kingdoms that rule in the wake of the Galactic Empire are struggling economically. Our economic strength is a testament to the benefits of being part of our Empire. People tend to vote with their feet, they move to the most profitable areas. This simple fact guarantees a growing support base."

 ZER_strong_but_steady_hand:0 "Strong but Steady Hand"
 ZER_strong_but_steady_hand_desc:0 "There are of course other factors to garner support from the former Imperial states, however, the most powerful is a strong military. By bending the petty warlords of the galaxy to their knees under the insurmountable power of our military, we are able to ensure their loyalties and force them to our side, lest they be destroyed."

 ZER_hosnian_deal:0 "Hosnian Deal"
 ZER_hosnian_deal_desc:0 "In our current state, we are unable to combat the growing rebel threat, we must form diplomatic ties with them temporarily to preserve our strength. Unifying the Empire will take the full force of our country's military, we do not have time to deal with the rebels. Once the Empire has been unified we will crush the scum of the galaxy!"

 ZER_the_just_emperor:0 "The Just Emperor"
 ZER_the_just_emperor_desc:0 "The Empire has been united. One people. One unified force. The Imperial banner waves across the Galaxy but only after countless lives have been lost. The galaxy sees Harrsk as a crazed lunatic who has aspirations to be Emperor, we must prove to them that Harrsk is prepared to rule a vast galaxy and care for the lives of trillions of people."

 ZER_imperial_war_machine:0 "Imperial War Machine"
 ZER_imperial_war_machine_desc:0 "The factories churn out weapons. Our soldiers train to destroy their enemies. Hundreds of warships lie in our ports and hangars. We are ready.

A new crusade to unite the Imperial kingdoms and return power to the seat of the Emperor."

 ZER_teradoc_issue:0 "Crippling the Teradocs"
 ZER_teradoc_issue_desc:0 "The Teradoc family, a stain on the Imperial name, they must be eliminated. Our superior military should make short work of the proclaimed Teradoc Union and the Greater Maldrood. Harrsk will be pleased by their defeat."

 ZER_conquest_of_corellia:0 "Conquering Corellia"
 ZER_conquest_of_corellia_desc:0 "Corellia is a powerful world with manufacturies that could accelerate our ascension to the Galactic Empire. Taking the world will be difficult because of the world's vast industrial areas and the power that the planet possesses. The Lord High Admiral wishes to use Shockwave to probe the enemy and then bring the bulk of Zero Command's forces to crush the resistance."

 ZER_conquest_of_nubia:0 "Conquering Nubia"
 ZER_conquest_of_nubia_desc:0 "The world of Nubia is yet another planet on the path to Coruscant. They should put up little resistance and our stormtroopers will be able to storm the planet's administration in short order. We suggest taking the planet quickly as Nubia seems to have some ties with the resistance which could complicate our invasion."

 ZER_conquest_of_aargau:0 "Conquest of Aargau"
 ZER_conquest_of_aargau_desc:0 "So close to the galaxy's capital of Coruscant, Aargau will provide us with an adequate base of operations in our crusade. Construction of military facilities will begin promptly after the world is taken by our forces."

 ZER_core_our_territory:0 "Consolidate our Territory"
 ZER_core_our_territory_desc:0 "With the large swathes of territory that we possess, resistance to our rule is becoming an increasingly urgent issue.

 ZER_grand_reclamation_army:0 "Grand Reclamation Army"
 ZER_grand_reclamation_army_desc:0 "With our warships closing in on Coruscant, we must make a push to recruit all able bodied recruits for the military.

 ZER_developing_our_science_base:0 "Developing our Science Base"
 ZER_developing_our_science_base_desc:0 "Although many officers will not admit it, the Zero Command military is lacking. Using equipment widely regarded as outdated left over from the Galactic Empire’s fall, our military strategists are not confident that we would be able to survive a large conflict. We must invest in our science community and search for new ways to empower our forces."

 ZER_increase_research_funding:0 "Increase Research Funding"
 ZER_increase_research_funding_desc:0 "One of the first steps to improving our scientific research capabilities is to increase the funding that goes to researchers. Although funding is limited, we will invest our money in projects that demonstrate promise such as modifications for our star destroyers, tie fighters, and infantry equipment."

 ZER_seek_out_gifted_individuals:0 "Seek out Gifted Individuals"
 ZER_seek_out_gifted_individuals_desc:0 "Currently Zero Command is experiencing what many would call a ‘brain drain’ as scientists and engineers leave our territory to work for rivals that will provide them with much more in return. Seeking out the gifted individuals we have in our education system and ensuring their loyalty will provide us with a stable body of scientists."

 ZER_deep_3:0 "DEEP 3"
 ZER_deep_3_desc:0 "DEEP 3 is a proposed research facility that would provide an area for our scientists to research and manufacture advanced weaponry. The construction of such a facility will be expensive, but we will be able to construct a shell and continually improve the station over time. We will begin work immediately."

 ZER_maintain_secrecy:0 "Maintain Secrecy"
 ZER_maintain_secrecy_desc:0 "Our new facility DEEP 3 must be kept in secrecy because of its purpose. War is not meant to be shared to the public and allowing outside eyes to peer into the projects that our engineers are working on may provide the enemy with an advantage."

 ZER_public_research:0 "Public Research"
 ZER_public_research_desc:0 "Although DEEP 3 will provide our scientists with an adequate research facility, it will also attract new researchers. Making this facility public will allow us to have a larger science community and maybe attract scientists outside of our territory."

 ZER_advanced_research_methods:0 "Advanced Research Methods"
 ZER_advanced_research_methods_desc:0 "Now that we have established research institutions with the capability to provide us with advanced weapons to defend our borders, we must once again expand as our rivals begin to eye our territory."

 ZER_factories_for_the_people_desc:0 "Many of the people in our nation require jobs to lift them from their permanent poverty. We will construct new factories that will both improve our exports/consumer goods and fix the employment crisis that has plagued Kalist VI and other large planets."

 ZER_durasteel_foundries:0 "Durasteel Foundries"
 ZER_durasteel_foundries_desc:0 "Durasteel is essential for the production of small arms and military vehicles as well as our warships, although Kalist VI provides us with a significant amount of durasteel, expanding the mines on the planet would provide further material for our warmachines to be built from."

 ZER_kalist_arms_company:0 "Kalist VI Arms Company"
 ZER_kalist_arms_company_desc:0 "Private companies such as the Kalist VI Arms Company can help our stockpile of weapons, investing money into these companies will give us further customisation in the production of weapons by private companies."

 ZER_underground_foundries:0 "Underground Foundries"
 ZER_underground_foundries_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk already maintains a selection of underground facilities to provide security to the high command and manufactories that cannot be bombed. Expanding this section of our industry provides Zero Command will the possibility to manufacture weapons despite being occupied on the surface."

 ZER_fuel_for_the_fleet:0 "Fuel for the Fleet"
 ZER_fuel_for_the_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet requires large amounts of rhydonium to fuel the engines of our warships, we have a large quantity located on Kalist VI but further exploitation of this research will provide us with even greater benefits in the range of our fleet."

 ZER_future_expansion:0 "Future Expansion"
 ZER_future_expansion_desc:0 "Kalist VI is already a developed world but our plans for future expansion would be stunted by the amount of land in reasonable areas available for construction of new manufacturing facilities, we will expand our infrastructure to provide more room in the urban areas where these factories thrive."

 ZER_industrial_powerhouse:0 "An Industrial Powerhouse"
 ZER_industrial_powerhouse_desc:0 "Our economy has grown significantly and is now able to sustain our growing territories, Harrsk must announce this to the people, a cause for much celebration. There are dark days to come but for the citizens of our empire, there is prosperity."

 ZER_zero_command_endures:0 "Zero Command Endures"
 ZER_zero_command_endures_desc:0 "With Harrsk's decision to remain independent of other Imperial forces, we must announce to the people that there will be changes.

 ZER_centralised_economy:0 "Centralised Economy"
 ZER_centralised_economy_desc:0 "If we are to maintain our independence, we need a strong economy that will be able to manufacture weapons and material for our future war efforts.

 ZER_pursue_technology:0 "Pursue Technology"
 ZER_pursue_technology_desc:0 "Our independence is reliant on our technology; our enemies outnumber us, and the sheer firepower they possess is enough to defeat us. Our only hope of ensuring our sovereignty is technology: elite technologically advanced soldiers and warships that are able to defeat scores of enemies before being defeated."

 ZER_rally_the_people:0 "Rally the People"
 ZER_rally_the_people_desc:0 "The promise of independence from worse powers is a great unifier for our people, we must make use of their fear and rally them to the army and navy. Harrsk will make speeches and rally the people to our side but even with a large military, we may be crushed."

 ZER_kalist_banking_system:0 "Kalist Banking System"
 ZER_kalist_banking_system_desc:0 "It would be foolish to remove the Imperial credit from circulation in our economy, however, we must create a centralized banking system apart from the corrupt IBC in order to be truly self-sufficient.

 ZER_independent_of_the_empire:0 "Independent of the Empire"
 ZER_independent_of_the_empire_desc:0 "Although we are descended from the Galactic Empire, we must make the distinction to our subjects. We are Zero Command, an independent protectorate of Lord High Admiral Blitzer Harrsk.

 ZER_seizing_fondor_shipyards:0 "Seizing Fondor Shipyards"
 ZER_seizing_fondor_shipyards_desc:0 "Although the planets of Abregado Rae and Kalist VI are adequate defensive territories, their industrial capacity is limited. An opportunity has arrived as Fondor is isolated from the Empire and without the support of the Imperial Navy, has been left vulnerable. A precision strike from our technologically superior forces should bring Fondor to its knees."

 ZER_loyalty_to_harrsk:0 "Loyalty to Harrsk"
 ZER_loyalty_to_harrsk_desc:0 "Although Zero Command is thriving, Harrsk is concerned that too many of his officers hold sympathies towards the old Empire. Their loyalty belongs to Zero Command and the Lord High Admiral. We must ensure their loyalty to maintain stability in Harrsk's regime."

 ZER_blood_feud:0 "Blood Feud"
 ZER_blood_feud_desc:0 "Our rivalry with the Teradocs is widely known, we have an opportunity to eradicate them from the galaxy. Tretuen Teradoc is weak, and his forces are unprepared to combat with a technologically advanced military."

 ZER_enforce_our_rule:0 "Enforce our Rule"
 ZER_enforce_our_rule_desc:0 "Now that we control Fondor, we must integrate it as part of Zero Command. Its populace are accustomed to Imperial rule so bestowing a less strict system of governance will appease them and allow for easier integration."

 ZER_repair_the_shipyards:0 "Repair the Shipyards"
 ZER_repair_the_shipyards_desc:0 "The dockyards on Fondor are the most useful aspect of the planet, we will be able to use them to construct our advanced Star Destroyers.

 ZER_execute_the_teradocs_desc:0 "With the Teradoc Union defeated, we can execute Treuten Teradoc and proclaim our victory to the galaxy. His name was a stain on the Empire.

 ZER_new_opportunity:0 "New Opportunity"
 ZER_new_opportunity_desc:0 "The planets previously under the control of the Teradocs have been thoroughly convinced that their rule was legitimate and pure. We must convince them otherwise and integrate them into our core protectorate."

 ZER_warlord_of_the_core_desc:0 "With our territorial ambitions secured, Harrsk can now be declared the Great Warlord of the Core. We are able to defend our borders ferociously and even larger galactic powers will not be able to defeat us. Long live the Lord High Admiral!"
