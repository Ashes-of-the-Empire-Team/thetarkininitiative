### COUNTRY EVENTS ###
new_republic_focus.1.desc:0 "Following the Battle of Endor, and the Death of Emperor Palpatine, delegates from the Aqualish, Bith, Em'liy, Ewoks, Hoojibs, Jawas, Ortolans, Pinurguians, Rodians, Twi'leks, Ugnaughts, and Zeltrons have met on Endor to begin the formation of the Galactic Government known as the Alliance of Free Peoples."
new_republic_focus.2.desc:0 "The Republic and Empire have both had different policies on taxation. If we are to unite the galaxy once again we must choose how we will fund our new government as well as our military. Some are proposing we implement a new tax in order to pay for the costs associated with creating a new galactic government. Others say we should cut down on the currents tax rate to encourage planets to pledge allegiance to our cause."
new_republic_focus.3.desc:0 "Although the galaxy has been ruled by the iron fist of the Empire for years the scars of the previous government are still felt by many. Many worlds that were negelected by the Republic feel that the bureaucracy must be cut down and the government must function at a quicker pace. Other worlds however feel like such a radical change while the government is still so young is dangerous can can prove to have negative consequences should these reforms fail."
new_republic_focus.4.desc:0 "Crime has run rampant accross the galaxy long before the Empire existed however in recent years it has benefited us. The question as to if working with crime lords is a good idea while we try to gain legitimacy is something many leaders within the Rebellion are asking. If we continue to work with crime lords it may benefit us when it comes to reclaiming Coruscant and in dealing with spies however it may also reflect badly on our new government if we encourage crime to benefit ourselves."
new_republic_focus.5.desc:0 "The New Republic military is quite young and new. While we are still wondering how to best unite the galaxy it is best to focus on expanding one area of the armed forces. The military may benefit us when we are fighting on planets however having a strong navy is vital to maintaing our position within the galaxy"
