 main_naval_armaments_technology:0 "Basic Naval Armaments"
 main_naval_armaments_technology_desc:0 "Naval Armaments range from small, fixed laser cannons on the front of shuttles, to massive turbolasers that can penetrate even the thickest hulls of starships."
 secondary_naval_armaments_technology:0 "Concussion Missile Ballistics"
 secondary_naval_armaments_technology_desc:0 "While concussion spheres were good enough thousands of years ago, times have changed. Studying newer concussion missiles will allow us to better prepare for them, and design some of our own."

 ion_cannon_technology_1:0 "Basic Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_1_desc:0 "Ion cannons vary in size and strength, but the most basic function of one is to fire an ionized shot that will interfere with electrical systems. This can be used to short circuit or disable shields, weapon systems, and even entire ships."
 ion_cannon_technology_2:0 "Improved Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_2_desc:0 "New technological advancements have allowed us to tighten the beam accuracy of our Ion cannons, as well as strengthening the ionization capabilities of the weapon to up combat capabilities."
 ion_cannon_technology_3:0 "Advanced Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_3_desc:0 "Even further work on our ionization tech allow us equip our ships with pin-point accurate Ion cannons. The Ion cannons will now have self-repair capabilities, as well as being able to assist the gunner or gunner AI in faster, more accurate aiming."
 laser_cannon_technology_1:0 "Basic Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_1_desc:0 "Laser Cannons have been used for millennia. The idea is very simple: A really big blaster, welded to a ship with a button to fire it. Even the most basic of Laser cannons nowadays are far more advanced than this, but they have been kept around for a reason. Their use is very widespread, be it anti-starfighter defenses, or the main armaments of a starfighter."
 laser_cannon_technology_2:0 "Improved Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_2_desc:0 "Improvements to the fairly basic designs of laser cannons will allow for wider turn angles, faster movement, more precise shots, and even more powerful cannons."
 laser_cannon_technology_3:0 "Advanced Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_3_desc:0 "Our most advanced designs yet, these cannons have massively improved firepower over their predecessors. To compensate for this, the cooling system on the cannons have been overhauled, and heat should be less of an issue. As well, expanding the turn angles once again will allow nearly a 360 cone of fire for weapons on ships that support it."
 turbolaser_technology_1:0 "Basic Turbolasers"
 turbolaser_technology_1_desc:0 "Turbolasers are similar to laser cannons, but make use of capacitors that contain massive amounts of raw energy. Combined with galven coils in the barrels, even basic turbolasers can launch beams that carry two or more times the energy of a standard laser cannon."
 turbolaser_technology_2:0 "Improved Turbolasers"
 turbolaser_technology_2_desc:0 "By improving the efficiency of the galven coils within the barrels of turbolasers, we're able to notably increase the energy leaving the barrel of the turbolaser. However, this comes at the risk of faster energy drain."
 turbolaser_technology_3:0 "Advanced Turbolasers"
 turbolaser_technology_3_desc:0 "Doubling the capacitors and making them take up less space, while not taking away from their capabilities allow for an even greater blast of energy from the turbolasers. While the energy drain issue is even greater now, the firepower more than makes up for it."
 turbolaser_technology_4:0 "Futuristic Turbolasers"
 turbolaser_technology_4_desc:0 "The energy issues of the previous generation turbolasers have finally been fixed with new technology. Now, instead of storing energy taken from the ship's main generator, each turbolaser has a microgenerator to power it's capacitors between engagements."
 concussion_missile_technology_1:0 "Basic Concussion Missiles"
 concussion_missile_technology_1_desc:0 "A versatile and effective weapon, these concussion missiles are basic but good enough. They pack a punch behind them, while also not being too terribly expensive."
 concussion_missile_technology_2:0 "Improved Concussion Missiles"
 concussion_missile_technology_2_desc:0 "Modifying the payload of the concussion missiles, and the design of the missile itself will allow for a massively increased attack power."
 concussion_missile_technology_3:0 "Advanced Concussion Missiles"
 concussion_missile_technology_3_desc:0 "With some changes to the inner workings of the missile, we've achieved a very effective missile. Able to penetrate deeper into targets, while also carrying a larger payload will be more than enough."
 concussion_missile_upgrade:0 "Improved Missile Racks"
 concussion_missile_upgrade_desc:0 "The effectivity of our missiles means nothing if it takes too long to fire more than one. However, improvements to our storage techniques may fix this issue."
 concussion_missile_upgrade_2:0 "Armor-piercing Missiles"
 concussion_missile_upgrade_2_desc:0 "While concussion missiles are inherently armor-piercing, that is not to say we can't up the efficiency at which the missiles pierce armor."
