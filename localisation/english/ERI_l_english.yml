 ERIADU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC_old:0 "Although the Eriadu Authority's reign outside of the Deep Core was short lived, for a brief time it controlled some of the richest parts of the galaxy outside the core, centered around Eriadu (home of the wealthy Tarkin family) and the Seswanna Sector, with territory up and down the Rimma Trade Route and Hydian Way. Delvardus was initially fairly successful in the establishment of his Empire. Along with these wealthy planets, he managed to recruit the likes of General Maximilian Veers and the remainder of Blizzard Force, afterward granting himself the (rather irksome to Veers) title of Superior General. Will his ambition end up leading to his downfall, or to the rise of his new empire?"

 eriadu.0.t:0 "The Curious Case of Sander Delvardus"
 eriadu.0.d:0 "Sander Delvardus, at a young age, wedded an heiress of the Eriadu-based Tarkin family. Despite his marriage, Delvardus gained a reputation as a womanizer, with lovers spread across many spaceports. Attaining command of the Star Destroyer Brilliant, the newly-promoted naval captain lobbied for the position of naval overseer for the Rimma Trade Route. Delvardus had fallen in love with a refugee aid worker on Clak'dor VII named Seledra-Zin, and wanted to stage the fleet under his control from the planet just to be close to her. Delvardus's relationship with his mistress was not smooth, however; they argued frequently, and during one altercation, Delvardus struck her with a dynamic hammer. The resultant injury sent Seledra-Zin into a coma. Guilt-ridden and grief-stricken, Delvardus—who had since been elevated to the rank of Admiral—arranged for a suspended-animation casket for her to be installed in his personal quarters aboard the Brilliant. The quest to restore Seledra-Zin to health consumed Delvardus, and it became the overriding obsession of his life."
