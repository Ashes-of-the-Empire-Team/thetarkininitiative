 mm_imperial_remnants_desc:0 "The Emperor is dead. The fleets are scattered and are now under the control of the various governors, admirals and moffs. Many Imperial servicemen have become lethargic with a virulent defeatism due to the rebellions victory at Endor and the deaths of our most fearsome leaders. Though we are fractured, unlike them, we are still alive. There is yet hope and there will yet be an Empire. Take up arms and reclaim what is ours!"

 welcome_message:0 "Welcome to the §YAshes of the Empire§! §Cdev§! branch\n\n The death of §YPalpatine§! has caused dissaray in the galaxy. While the §RRebellion§! looks to unite the galaxy and restore the §ORepublic§!, §gImperial Warlords§! seize what they can and prepare to attempt to restore the §gEmpire§! to its former glory. Where will you bring this new galaxy? \n\nThis branch is §Rhighly unstable§! and is constantly receiving new updates and changes to the game. This branch serves more to show you features early and to test out features when we announce the completion of a new mechanic or focus tree. \n\nFor any questions be sure to ask on the §CDiscord§! and if you want to help in any way anyone can add contributions to the mod as long as they approved by the dev team. Thank you for trying out the mod and we look forward to showing you what we have been working on"
