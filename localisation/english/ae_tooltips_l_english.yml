Many Imperial servicemen have become lethargic with a virulent defeatism due to the rebellions victory at Endor and the deaths of our most fearsome leaders. Though we are fractured, unlike them, we are still alive. There is yet hope and there will yet be an Empire. Take up arms and reclaim what is ours!"
