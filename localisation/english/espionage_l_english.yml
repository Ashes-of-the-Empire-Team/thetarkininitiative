# TITLE DESC AND REWARD
espionage_mission_undecided:0 "No Current Mission Avaliable"
espionage_mission_1_idea:0 "§YOfficer Assassination§!\nAn undercover agent in the In The Target Country has provided us with the travel plans for a high-ranking officer. We've already dispatched a bounty hunter to make quick work of the officer."




espionage_mission_2_idea:0 "§YOfficer Ransom§!\nWe have recently discovered a resort frequented by the military officers from the In The Target Country for rest and recuperation. With so many important people going back and forth, it'd be a shame if one were to go missing..."
espionage_mission_3_idea:0 "§YArmy Training§!\nBounty Hunters are incredibly flexible, tactically. They know how to act in small, independent groups and plan ambushes from almost anywhere. Our commanders and soldiers could use this information, and the Bounty Hunters have agreed to teach them."
espionage_mission_4_idea:0 "§YIntimidate Senator§!\nThe word on the street is a senator from the In The Target Country has been partaking in socially reprehensible acts in private. This isn't something we care about, but the way the Senator has been voting is a problem. With the right words, we could solve this problem..."
espionage_mission_5_idea:0 "§YCyber Attack§!\nOur slicers have found a terminal in In The Target Country to have weak encryption. While the terminal itself is rather unimportant, it has connections to defence terminals. With some exploitation, this could lead to disaster for our target."
espionage_mission_6_idea:0 "§YSteal Blueprint§!\nA Research lab in In The Target Country has sent blueprints to be developed into prototypes, luckily for us, they are cutting costs and using improperly defended transportation. An agent could simply slip it, take the blueprints, and disappear."
espionage_mission_7_idea:0 "§YSprout Disease§!\nA virus has been discovered that only prospers in the atmosphere found on In The Target Country, releasing this in a capital city could potentially cause a planetwide pandemic and untold costs. Consider the consequences carefully."
espionage_mission_8_idea:0 "§YLogistics Sabotage§!\nThrough a mix of direct sabotage and swapping labels, our agents can cause a massive headache for In The Target Country when it's discovered that their equipment is faulty and barely functioning."
espionage_mission_9_idea:0 "§YIndustrial Sabotage§!\nIt's very clear that In The Target Country's industry is it's beating heart. A few screw loose, some parameters removed, and we can cause mass chaos in their factories."
espionage_mission_10_idea:0 "§YInfiltrate Military§!\nIt seems we have a turncoat. A high ranking officer in In The Target Country has offered to allow us access to important military data, in exchange for safety and impunity once the war is over."
espionage_mission_11_idea:0 "§YUndermine Guild§!\nThe relationship in In The Target Country between government and the guilds is an everchanging one. Perhaps, with a bit of a nudge, we can widen divsion between them and remove another ally from In The Target Country."
espionage_mission_12_idea:0 "§YDestroy Capital Ship§!\nDespite the danger of it, we could sneak an elite commando squad onto a In The Target Country capital ship via a hijacked transport craft. The squad would then move down to the lower levels, and set the ship to blow after their timely departure."
espionage_mission_13_idea:0 "§YSteal Equipment§!\nIt would our spies have located some guards in In The Target Country who have been slacking off. Of course, this would be a terrible thing to have happen... a small squad could easily break in and steal military supplies with little risk of being caught."
espionage_mission_14_idea:0 "§YSmuggle Slaves§!\nWithin In The Target Country controlled space, there is a slave trading hub. Slaves are never cheap to buy, but money wouldn't be an issue if we were to hijack an incoming or disembarking convoy loaded with slaves just fresh for the taking..."
espionage_mission_15_idea:0 "§YFree Slaves§!\nWithin In The Target Country controlled space, there is a slave trading hub. Keeping slaves isn't our cup of caf, but if we were to hijack a convoy, the slaves would be ever grateful, and we would welcome them to freedom."
espionage_mission_16_idea:0 "§YProvoke Slave Revolt§!\nIn The Target Country's slavetrade is abhorrent! However, In The Target Country should know that keeping such a large number of unhappy people with so little defenses is a bad idea. If we were to supply them weapons, the slaves would surely rise up."
espionage_mission_17_idea:0 "§YArm Dissidents§!\nWhile they may not agree with us entirely, many within In The Target Country have issues with the government. Issues that they wish to take out violently. Perhaps we should give them a few... tools to properly convey their emotions."
espionage_mission_18_idea:0 "§YPlant Sleeper Agent§!\nAn agent we placed within In The Target Country has finally rose through the ranks and been assigned a high-ranking position. To not take advantage of an opportunity like this would be a mistake."
espionage_mission_19_idea:0 "§YReroute Supply§!\nSupply lines are long and often times go through multiple forms of transportation and cargo inspections. If we were to take control of some out of the way infrastructure, we could reroute or seize equipment to ensure it never reaches the frontlines."
espionage_mission_20_idea:0 "§YMarket Crash§!\nA bank in In The Target Country has been picked up on by our local slicers as a major economic target. With some resources put toward it, our slicers may be able to get through a back door and cause the local market to crash."
