 eridau.4.t:0 "Wake in Sunset Bliss"
 eridau.4.d:0 "Light streams in from a barely open window, illuminating a man awaking to the world like a lamb first opening their eyes. He looks drealy around the room and feels insidious panic. For he was not in his bed, the woman that was asleep beside him was certainly not his woman and the man beside her, standing glaring, was not his servant."
 eridau.4.a:0 "'Oh fuck'"
 eridau.5.t:0 "The Grand Escape"
 eridau.5.d:0 "'So, your solution to escape was to throw yourself out a window and drop 3 stories?' questions Sander sitting at a desk opposite a battered womaniser. 'Well I hit 3 signs on the way down so its more like 3 consecutive 1 story drops.' 'Right, did mother also drop you on your head?' An uncomfortable amount of time passes in silence 'Wren I think you need to find something to do' Sander states, 'Yeah sure brother, Ill find something to do' He winks coly"
 eridau.5.a:0 "'Please stop winking, and be silent.'"
 eridau.6.t:0 "Voices"
 eridau.6.d:0 "For the second time in the night Wren wakes to the voices again, they always come in different style. Sometimes children crying out for their mothers, others times older voices all out for their loved ones asking where they went. This time is an investment banker trying to bargain with a deity for another chance."
 eridau.6.a:0 "Wren grabs the sleeping pills and alcohol and prepares for another long night"
 eridau.7.t:0 "A Brothers Service"
 eridau.7.d:0 "'You're being sent to Sullust to serve in the infantry,' 'What are you on about?' 'My hands are tied, you have sat gorging yourself on food and women since the fall of the empire because you thought no one cared and the nobles are starting to notice calling you and me weak. Frankly I agree with them'"
 eridau.7.a:0 "'Fuck, you're going to place me away from the front though right? right? Sander?'"
 eridau.8.t:0 "Trapped In A Bad Place"
 eridau.8.d:0 "A convoy of shuttles and fighter craft courses over the Reaksh lava lake of Sullust, their target a mining facility operated by the New Republic and apparently their sources of ammunition in this area. Inside the shuttle is a crack team of alcoholics, theives, abusers and the brother of Sander. The shooting starts within 20km of the compound, shrieking metal wailing as laser bolts strike the shuttle. Inside the fear is palpable, people kissing photos of loved ones, while Wren thinks of how he will die here. In an unknown land, his brother not caring."
 eridau.8.a:0 "I just want to be back home"
 eridau.9.t:0 "Landing"
 eridau.9.d:0 "The doors open, the team rushes out under gunfire. Screams of slurs and rage sound out against the enemy. But that doesn't fill Wrens head, the cries of people choking their prayers scars his mind instead. He hears it all, a cacophony of cries. 'I want you to know I loved you' 'Why did you leave, please stay with me' 'I wanted to make you proud, please be proud of me', it all echoes rebounding, intensifying, seemingly never ending."
 eridau.9.a:0 "Until the compassion of nothingness takes him"
 eridau.10.t:0 "What I am now"
 eridau.10.d:0 "Silence fills the air, amid the wreckage and bodies awakes one. Whispers still in his head, like little hammers striking against his skull, over and over again. He stumbles, a new kitten finding its way blind. The whispers guiding him, taking him into their embrace becoming louder. Louder, shouting, screaming, silent. He looks up, the wreckage of a craft in front of him"
 eridau.10.a:0 ""
 eridau.11.t:0 "What I can see"
 eridau.11.d:0 "Voice booms, 'Seeking seems to have led you to me, lost Choreamno. You are nothing, a womaniser, a glutton, a slave to your whims. You lack strength of yourself' 'What is going on?' 'Let me show you what you desired' A vision enters Wrens mind, his father, as cold and uncaring as he normally was, this time looks so very sad. 'I loved you Son, I am so sorry I didn't tell you,' and the vision fades once again."
 eridau.11.a:0 "'Bring him back'"
 eridau.12.t:0 "What I don't understand:0 "
 eridau.12.d:0 "'I cant bring him back, he is gone, absorbed with the force of all things. You, Choreamno, have a affinity to pick the force at a strand. The force of all things to some is a fabric or a weave, to pick at a strand is to understand a individual that makes up the fabric. When one dies with a lingering need they stay, malice envy and unbridled greed making corruption of their very soul and the integration impossible. With time and training you, like I, can read a last thought and be able to ease people into this life energy.'  "
 eridau.12.a:0 "'Even if this is all true, why should I care?'"
 eridau.13.t:0 "What I can become"
 eridau.13.d:0 "'Why do you lie to yourself? You are not heartless as you have led yourself to believe, do you honestly expect me to believe that those cries for help did not resonate with you, that pang of fear and regret, you can help them. You can be their last rite, their passage, their noble death. Seek out the Wellspring, then you shall know. Then when your ready, I will be your first rite, your initiation into the order.'"
 eridau.13.a:0 "'All right, but do not expect me to come back' §Y This might have consequences a year from now.§!"
